# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Endoscopic-Surgery-Equipments
This report presents semantic segmentation models designed for the identification and labeling of  instruments in robotic-assisted surgeries. The objective is to accurately classify each pixel within the surgical scene according to its corresponding instrument class. Semantic segmentation of surgical instruments serves as a fundamental task in the development of robotic -assisted surgery systems, facilitating instrument tracking, pose and surgical phase prediction ,etc.. By developing robust methods for semantic segmentation of surgical instruments, this project aims to drive progress across multiple domains of study
