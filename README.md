# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Endoscopic-Surgery-Equipments
This report presents semantic segmentation models designed for the identification and labeling of  instruments in robotic-assisted surgeries. The objective is to accurately classify each pixel within the surgical scene according to its corresponding instrument class. Semantic segmentation of surgical instruments serves as a fundamental task in the development of robotic -assisted surgery systems, facilitating instrument tracking, pose and surgical phase prediction ,etc.. By developing robust methods for semantic segmentation of surgical instruments, this project aims to drive progress across multiple domains of study
# **The Dataset**
In this project, Dataset used is from Robotic Scene Segmentation Sub-Challenge of Endovis 2018.

**Data collection :**
The dataset comprised 19 videos of surgeries, which were divided into 15 training sets and 4 test sets. Each sequence stemmed from a singular porcine training procedure recorded on da Vinci X or Xi systems, utilizing specialized hardware. The frames underwent manual filtering until each sequence attained a total of 300 frames. 

**Data Annotation:** 
The data was annotated by a team of trained professionals using specialized software, which generated boundaries around each semantic class. Quality control measures were implemented throughout the annotation process. Annotating anatomical data requires following a complex protocol to address ambiguities and ensure consistent labeling while adhering to higher-level objectives for system development. Additionally, a challenge is presented by the difficulty or impossibility of identifying structures in many camera views. Instead, an extended sequence of images capturing the structure from various angles and distances needs to be reviewed by annotators. Many annotation tools operate on individual images without seamlessly integrating the viewing of video sequences into the workflow, thereby complicating the process.
